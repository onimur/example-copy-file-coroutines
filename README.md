### Example Coroutines Task
This example refers to my question posted on [Kotlin Discussion](https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/read-and-copy-file-with-coroutines/18145), [StackOverFlow-En](https://stackoverflow.com/q/62486876/10526030) and [StackOverFlow-Pt](https://pt.stackoverflow.com/questions/458209/ler-e-copiar-arquivos-utilizando-coroutines).

In it I added the answers and suggestions that were given.

## Details
In the application, I copy files from one directory to another, to simulate simultaneous background tasks using Kotlin Coroutines / Flow.
